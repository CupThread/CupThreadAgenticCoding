## Base URL & Environment
- **Production API Base**: `https://api.cupthread.com`
- **Interactive Reference UI**: `https://cupthread.com/api`

## Roles & Authentication
- **Developer / Console Access**: Developer API token / Bearer token (`cpt_...`) or Clerk session header (`/api/v1/console/*`).
- **End-User / Public SDK Access**: Identified by `appKey` in path/query/body, optional `X-User-Token` header (UUID v4) for anonymous user voting and comment tracking (`/api/v1/public/*`, `/api/v1/feedback`, `/api/v1/feature-requests`).

## Key Public & SDK Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `/api/v1/public/config/:appKey` | `GET` | Fetches the `PublicAppConfig`: app metadata, store/website links (`websiteUrl`), branding flags (`hideSiteBranding`), enabled platforms, and anonymous-access settings. |
| `/api/v1/public/workspaces/:workspaceSlug/apps/:appSlug/config` | `GET` | Same `PublicAppConfig` resolved by workspace and app slugs instead of app key. |
| `/api/v1/public/columns/:appKey` | `GET` | Roadmap Kanban columns sorted by position. |
| `/api/v1/public/versions/:appKey` | `GET` | Release versions sorted by position. |
| `/api/v1/public/apps/:appKey/changelog` | `GET` | Published release notes and changelog items. |
| `/api/v1/public/apps/:appKey/changelog/subscribe` | `POST` | Subscribe email to changelog updates. |

| `/api/v1/public/apps/:appKey/user` | `PUT` | Update host app user attributes (paying, MRR, currency). |
| `/api/v1/feature-requests` | `GET` | List/search feature requests (`limit`, `offset`, `versionId`, `q`). |
| `/api/v1/feature-requests` | `POST` | Submit a new feature request. |
| `/api/v1/feature-requests/:id/vote` | `POST` | Upvote / remove vote on a feature request. |
| `/api/v1/feature-requests/:id/comments` | `GET` | List comments and @replies on a feature request. |
| `/api/v1/feature-requests/:id/comments` | `POST` | Post a comment or @reply on a feature request. |
| `/api/v1/users/:userId/profile` | `GET` | Public user profile, apps, and recent comments. |

## Submission Quota Errors (`402 Payment Required`)

`POST /api/v1/feature-requests` (and, with the same contract, `POST /api/v1/feedback`) responds with `402 Payment Required` and an `ErrorResponse` body (`{"error": string, "code"?: string}`) when the app's workspace cannot accept new submissions:

| `code` | Meaning | Actionable guidance |
|---|---|---|
| `tier_limit_submissions` | The workspace reached its monthly submission quota. | Do not retry automatically. Tell the user to upgrade the workspace plan (Console → Billing) or wait for the quota to reset, then resubmit. |
| `subscription_inactive` | The workspace subscription is inactive or canceled. | Do not retry automatically. Tell the user to renew/reactivate the subscription (Console → Billing); submissions keep failing until then. |

Agents and SDK clients should parse the `code` field, treat `402` as a deterministic business rule (never a transient error), and surface the guidance above to the end user.
